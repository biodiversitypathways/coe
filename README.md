# Analyzing natural area sensitivity thresholds for humans and species diversity in Albertaâ€™s Capital City

Urbanization reshapes landscapes, which increases the need for green spaces while balancing anthropogenic challenges like noise pollution that can harm biodiversity and health. This project proposes a zero-emissions monitoring program using autonomous recording units to assess noise impacts in Edmonton. By guiding sustainable urban planning, we aim to create quieter, greener cities that support both people and wildlife.
